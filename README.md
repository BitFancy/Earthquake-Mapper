## Features

- **Real-Time Data**: The application fetches earthquake data in real-time from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) API, ensuring that users have access to the latest seismic information.

- **Advanced Filtering**: Users can customize their earthquake exploration experience with a range of powerful filters, including magnitude, location, and time frame. This enables users to focus on earthquakes that are most relevant to their interests and research.

- **Map Styles**: Choose from a selection of map styles to tailor the visualization to your preferences. Options include default, light, dark, and satellite views, providing flexibility for various use cases.

- **Fault Lines**: Gain deeper insights into tectonic activity by overlaying tectonic fault lines on the map. This feature helps users understand the geological context of earthquakes.

- **Buffer Zone Analysis**: The application includes a buffer zone tool powered by Turf.js, allowing users to generate custom buffer zones around recent earthquakes. This feature is invaluable for assessing potential impact areas.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows both novice and experienced users to easily navigate and access earthquake data.



## Technologies

- **Frontend Technologies**: The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly frontend interface.

- **Mapping Library**: Leaflet.js is used for mapping functionality, providing an interactive and customizable map experience.

- **Map Tiles**: OpenStreetMap is the source of map tiles, ensuring high-quality and up-to-date cartography.

- **Geospatial Analysis**: Turf.js is utilized for geospatial analysis tasks, such as buffer zone generation.

- **Data Source**: The United States Geological Survey (USGS) API provides real-time earthquake data, enriching the application with the latest seismic information.
